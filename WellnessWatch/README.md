The purpose of the final project is to apply mobile programming knowledge by designing and developing a real-life mobile app. This is a semester long course project. In each group, there will be 5-6 members.

**Submission** 
You have to submit all project related stuffs into this GitHub repo. You don't need to submit anything in Canvas. 

**You can come up with new idea as your final project. We will talk more in the class.** 

**Please don't pick To-Do or  any clock or Timer related app.**

**Requirements for final project:  You have to implement any 10 android concepts from the following list into your final project.**

| API | Navigation | Fragments | WorkManager | Firebase | Room | Unit Testing (min 10 cases) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| **ViewModel LiveData** | **MVVM Pattern** | **Repository Pattern** | **RecyclerView** | **Permission** | **Material design** | **Notifications** |



1. **Project Proposal presentation and proposal report**
   - Presentation
      - You and your group will give a 10 minutes in-class presentation using slides. 
      - Mention you app name and group members name.
      - Reason to choose this project.
      - Explain potential features.
      - Explain potential Kotlin concepts of your app.
   - Report
      - The length of the proposal must be more than 2 pages.
      - You have to mention the app name and names of the group members. 
      - Reason to choose this project.
      - Explain potential features.
      - Explain potential Kotlin concepts of your app.
3. **Mid Progress Design and Code Presentation**
   - All group members MUST be present during the mid-progress presentation to the class (unless there is an emergency such as a health or family emergency). Each member will present for around 2 minutes. Each group will get 10 minutes.
   - You don't need to prepare slides for presentation.  
   - In this presentation, you will show the current status of the project.  At this point of time, you should complement 50% of your code. 
     - You will demo the current code in Android Studio.
     - You can show the Mock up design if you have. 
   - The instructor and your cohorts will give feedback on the project (for 2 minutes). 
   - In summary, each group will have 12 minutes (max) for presentation and feedback. 
4. **Final Presentation**
   - Prepare slides for a 9 minutes presentation and project/app demo for a 3-minute presentation.  Each member will present for 2 minutes or more. 
   - The presentation contents will be similar to your written report and submitted code. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the challenging part in the presentation and demo your project for 3 minutes out of 12 minutes. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the innovation and merit of your project.
5. **Final written report (Font size: 12,  single line spacing, number of pages: 6- 8 (excluding appendix), One column format )**
   - Summary/Abstract
   - Introduction
   - App description (describe different Features). You can check the app description of the square  [cash app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareup.cash)  as an example. 
   - Discussion (challenges, innovation, merit)
   - List of implemented concepts in your project  (e.g., API). Here, you have to mention which files you have implemented each concept in your code. 
   - Limitations (mention any error in the application, unfinished task, any change after the proposal)
   - A table of group members and their contributions (e.g., API implementation, UI design, writing report, etc.) to the project.
   - Conclusion
   - References.
   - Appendix
      - You have to give screenshots of all your kotlin code in the appendix. 
      - All output screenshots of your app



6. **Peer Evaluation (Individual):** This task should not take more than 10 minutes. Every student MUST complete a peer evaluation survey to get his/her score. The survey link and the submission deadline will be available on the ABET system. It will take only a few minutes to complete this peer evaluation survey. _You will be penalized 5 points if we don't receive your peer evaluation before the deadline. The following indicators will be used in peer evaluation_. 
   - _Listen to other teammates_: Consistently listens and responds to others appropriately
   - _Cooperate in harmony_: Never argues with teammates negatively
   - _Make fair decisions_: Always helps the team to reach a fair decision
   - _Research and gather information_: Collects a great deal of information--all are relevant to the topic
   - _Share information_: Relays all relevant information to teammates
   - _Offer help_: Offers help proactively and all the times when asked
   - _Full Assigned work_: Performs all assigned works
   - _Time management_:  Hands all assignments on time
   - _Contribute to a team meeting_: Gives all-important progress updates and contribute greatly to ideation

1. **Final deliverable** The following are the final deliverables: 
   - Peer Review: You must complete the ABET peer evaluation.
   - Code: You have to push all project-related code in GitHub
   - Video: You have to make a video, demo the app(If you already made demo app vedio for final presentation, you can just use it here), and show your code. You can make a 4-5 minute video. Push that in this repo. In case, you have problem with uploading big files in GitHub, you can upload big files here. [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MEhSDHg7d9tZe557LuJtS6rk9FBeSvlv?usp=sharing)
   - Report: You must push your proposal, and final report.
   - Slides: You have to upload all your slides as pdf.

Your submission will be graded by simply running it and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive **partial** credit.
